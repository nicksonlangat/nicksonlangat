# Hi, My name is Nick Langat

I am a software engineer who enjoys and appreciates problem solving and making digital things easier to use.
I have built and scaled backend systems, styled and improved frontend layers, deployed code to production and configured CI/CD pipelines.

I am currently looking for a new, challenging and fulfilling role and while I do so, I'm involved in some beautiful activities that I highlight below:

## SIDE PROJECTS

 I am a conscientious worker, constantly seeking to improve my knowledge and keep up with the ever-evolving software engineering domain.
 I enjoy enhancing my skills by developing my own projects and I'm currently actively maintaining the following:
 ### Navis
 Navis is a company that provides logistics, shipping, warehousing and fulfilment services. This platform aims to give staff, managers and admins a positive and high experience when 
 using the dashboard. It is powered by a Django and DRF backend and a Vue/Tailwind frontend, all deployed on AWS.

I enjoy mentoring, troubleshooting and answering questions and I do so wholeheartedly, so are you stuck in your project, facing a bug or need someone to review your code? Let me take a look and I'd be glad to help.

## TECHNICAL WRITER

When you teach someone, you learn twice and no better way of giving back to the dev community than transferring knowledge to newcomers and veterans alike. I contribute to the programming community by writing technical articles and tutorials and my posts have been read over 29,500 times. Here are some of my most read articles:

# MORE ABOUT ME

I am comfortable working across the stack as a full-stack engineer. I’m more biased towards backend and DevOps but I'm not afraid to touch frontend code. I am productive in Python, Django, AWS, SQL, React, Vue and Tailwind, therefore I can fit in levels of the technical stack. I am a quick, avid, curious and constant learner willing to get my feet wet and learn a new language, library or framework. I maintain a learner mindset and that has allowed me to level up with new tech stacks in the ever dynamic field of software.

I am driven by curiosity and a deep rooted desire which leads me to pose questions like “how can this logic be simplified?”, “how can this query be optimized and improved?”, “what is the impact of this system architecture over X?”, to me and to my colleagues alike. I value code simplicity and performance and I'm committed to quality. I work hard to eliminate unnecessary duplication or awkward workarounds. I'm passionate about rigorous engineering practices and discipline: code reviews, automated testing, logging, monitoring, alerting, etc.

I welcome new opportunities that are challenging and exciting in fast paced agile environment that offers great work life balance and opportunities of personal and professional growth. I'm on a path to becoming an engineering manager and I'm taking one step at a time!
